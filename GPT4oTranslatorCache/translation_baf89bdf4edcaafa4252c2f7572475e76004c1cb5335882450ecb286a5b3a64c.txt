| PageTest      | Each test gets a fresh copy of a web [Page] 建立 in its own unique [BrowserContext]. Extending this 類別 is the simplest way of writing a fully-functional Playwright test。<br></br><br></br>Note: You can override the `ContextOptions` method in each test file to control context options, the ones typically passed into the [Browser.NewContextAsync](/api/class-browser.mdx#browser-new-context) method。That way you can specify all kinds of emulation options for your test file individually。|
| ContextTest   | Each test will get a fresh copy of a [BrowserContext]. You can 建立 as many pages in this context as you'd like。Using this test is the easiest way to test multi-page scenarios where you need more than one tab。<br></br><br></br>Note: You can override the `ContextOptions` method in each test file to control context options, the ones typically passed into the [Browser.NewContextAsync](/api/class-browser.mdx#browser-new-context) method。That way you can specify all kinds of emulation options for your test file individually。|
| BrowserTest   | Each test will get a browser and can 建立 as many contexts as it likes。Each test is responsible for cleaning up all the contexts it 建立。|
| PlaywrightTest | This gives each test a Playwright 物件 so that the test could start and stop as many browsers as it likes。|
